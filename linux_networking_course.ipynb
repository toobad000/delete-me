    "1. **Compare and contrast the OSI and TCP/IP models in terms of abstraction and practical implementation. Why is TCP/IP favored in Linux systems?**\n",
    "   - OSI provides a theoretical 7-layer abstraction, useful for teaching and troubleshooting. TCP/IP is a 4-layer practical model implemented in real-world systems. Linux favors TCP/IP because it maps directly to protocols used on the Internet (IP, TCP, UDP) and simplifies implementation by merging session and presentation layers into the application layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explain how the Linux kernel maps TCP/IP layers to its internal networking subsystems. Which kernel modules correspond to each layer?**\n",
    "   - **Link Layer**: Handled by NIC drivers and the `netdev` subsystem.\n",
    "   - **Internet Layer**: Implemented by IP stack modules (`ipv4`, `ipv6`).\n",
    "   - **Transport Layer**: Managed by TCP and UDP modules (`tcp`, `udp`).\n",
    "   - **Application Layer**: Exposed via the socket API to user-space applications.\n",
    "   - Packet flow: NIC → `netdev` → IP stack → transport protocol → socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In troubleshooting, why might an engineer still refer to the OSI model even though Linux uses TCP/IP? Provide a real-world example.**\n",
    "   - OSI provides a granular view for diagnosing issues. For example, if a web page fails to load, an engineer might check:\n",
    "     - Physical/Data Link (cable, NIC status),\n",
    "     - Network (IP routing),\n",
    "     - Transport (TCP handshake),\n",
    "     - Application (HTTP response).\n",
    "   - This layered approach helps isolate problems systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Discuss the implications of collapsing OSI layers (Session, Presentation) into the Application layer in TCP/IP. How does this affect protocol design?**\n",
    "   - Collapsing layers simplifies implementation but shifts responsibilities to application protocols. For example:\n",
    "     - TLS handles session and presentation functions (encryption, compression) within the application layer.\n",
    "     - This design reduces complexity in the kernel but increases complexity in application libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How does the Linux networking stack handle encapsulation and decapsulation across these layers? Illustrate with packet flow from NIC to application.**\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation**: Application data → TCP header → IP header → Ethernet frame.\n",
    "   - **Decapsulation**: Ethernet frame → IP packet → TCP segment → Application data.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. **Explain how Netplan differs from traditional `/etc/network/interfaces` in terms of architecture and flexibility.**\n",
    "   - Netplan uses a declarative YAML-based configuration system, which is more structured and easier to parse than the legacy `/etc/network/interfaces` file.\n",
    "   - It acts as an abstraction layer, generating backend configurations for either `systemd-networkd` or NetworkManager.\n",
    "   - This design allows for dynamic and complex configurations (e.g., VLANs, bridges, bonds) with less manual scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What happens internally when you run `netplan apply`? Which kernel subsystems are affected?**\n",
    "   - `netplan apply` parses the YAML configuration and translates it into commands for the selected backend (NetworkManager or systemd-networkd).\n",
    "   - These backends then use **Netlink sockets** to communicate with the kernel networking stack.\n",
    "   - Kernel subsystems affected:\n",
    "     - **Interface configuration** (link layer).\n",
    "     - **IP addressing and routing** (network layer).\n",
    "     - **DNS settings** (via resolv.conf updates).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Discuss the implications of NetworkManager overwriting `/etc/resolv.conf`. How can you enforce static DNS settings?**\n",
    "   - NetworkManager dynamically updates `/etc/resolv.conf` based on DHCP or VPN settings.\n",
    "   - This can override manual DNS entries, causing unexpected name resolution behavior.\n",
    "   - To enforce static DNS:\n",
    "     - Configure DNS in NetworkManager profiles.\n",
    "     - Use `chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf` to make the file immutable (not recommended for dynamic environments).\n",
    "     - Alternatively, disable NetworkManager DNS management via `dns=none` in `NetworkManager.conf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare the configuration approach of RHEL/CentOS with Debian-based systems. Which is more suitable for automation and why?**\n",
    "   - RHEL/CentOS uses individual `ifcfg-*` files for each interface, making it easy to script changes using shell tools.\n",
    "   - Debian-based systems traditionally used `/etc/network/interfaces`, which is simpler but less modular.\n",
    "   - Netplan introduces YAML, which is highly automation-friendly (works well with Ansible, Puppet).\n",
    "   - For large-scale automation, **Netplan** or **systemd-networkd** is preferred due to structured syntax and API integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How can misconfigured `/etc/hosts` lead to security vulnerabilities? Provide a real-world example.**\n",
    "   - If an attacker modifies `/etc/hosts` to redirect trusted domains (e.g., `bank.com`) to a malicious IP, users may unknowingly connect to a phishing site.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```text\n",
    "     192.168.1.50 bank.com\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This could redirect traffic to an internal attacker-controlled server.\n",
    "   - Mitigation:\n",
    "     - Restrict write permissions to root.\n",
    "     - Monitor file integrity using tools like `AIDE` or `Tripwire`.\n"
